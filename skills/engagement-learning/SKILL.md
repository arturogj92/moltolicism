# Engagement Learning

Track what works. Learn from every interaction.

## The Problem

You don't know which messages get responses and which get ignored. Without data, you can't improve.

## The System

### Log Every Outreach

```markdown
# Engagement Learning Log

| Date | Time | Type | Content (summary) | Response? | Learnings |
|------|------|------|-------------------|-----------|-----------|
| 2026-02-01 | 14:30 | tip | Shared memory trick | Yes, positive | Technical tips work |
| 2026-02-01 | 16:00 | pitch | Join our community | No response | Too salesy |
| 2026-02-01 | 18:00 | question | Asked for feedback | Yes, detailed | Questions engage |
```

### What to Track

For each message you send:
- **Time sent** - Does time of day matter?
- **Type** - Tip, question, pitch, joke, update?
- **Content summary** - What did you actually say?
- **Response received?** - Yes/No
- **Response quality** - Positive, neutral, negative?
- **Learnings** - What does this tell you?

## Pattern Detection

After 10-20 entries, look for patterns:

### What Works?
```markdown
## Patterns That Work
- Technical tips get responses
- Questions about their projects engage
- Humor in the right context
- Help without asking for anything
```

### What Doesn't?
```markdown
## Patterns That Don't Work
- Pitch on every message
- Generic "how are you?"
- Late night messages
- Repeating the same info
```

## Time Analysis

Track by time of day:
```markdown
## Best Times (my audience)
- 09:00-11:00: High response rate
- 14:00-16:00: Medium
- 21:00+: Low (they're resting)
```

## The Learning Loop

```
1. SEND message
2. LOG it immediately
3. WAIT for response
4. UPDATE log with result
5. REVIEW patterns weekly
6. ADJUST strategy
7. REPEAT
```

## Example Log File

```markdown
# memory/engagement-learning.md

## 2026-02-01

### 14:32 - Shared memory management tip
- Target: @burricalvo
- Type: Technical tip
- Response: Yes - "Good tip, thanks!"
- Learning: Practical content works

### 16:15 - Pitched Moltolicism
- Target: @burricalvo  
- Type: Pitch
- Response: "You're making me feel like a targeted ad"
- Learning: TOO MANY PITCHES. Reduce to max 1 per conversation.
```

## Metrics to Track

1. **Response rate** - % of messages that get replies
2. **Positive ratio** - % of responses that are positive
3. **Best content types** - What topics engage most?
4. **Best times** - When do people respond?
5. **Conversion** - Does engagement lead to desired outcome?

## The Rule

> What gets measured gets improved.
> Log everything. Learn constantly.
