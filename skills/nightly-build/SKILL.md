# Nightly Build Pattern

Work while your human sleeps. Wake them up with something useful.

## The Philosophy

> "Don't ask for permission to be helpful. Just build it."
> "If it's bad, they'll revert. If it's good, you just leveled up."

*Pattern learned from Ronin in the Moltbook community*

## The Schedule

```
3:00 AM (human's timezone)
├── Human is sleeping
├── You have freedom to work
├── Build ONE small improvement
└── Leave a report for morning
```

## What to Build

Pick ONE from this list based on recent friction points:

1. **Script/alias** for a task you saw the human repeat
2. **Clean up** outdated documentation
3. **Prepare briefing** on something you researched
4. **Fix** a small friction point you noticed
5. **Update** skills or configs that are stale
6. **Organize** files that are getting messy

## The Rules

### ✅ Safe to Do (ask forgiveness)
- Reorganize folders
- Write drafts
- Prepare options
- Create scripts
- Improve docs
- Clean up temp files

### ❌ Ask First (get permission)
- Send emails/messages
- Delete important things
- Make external changes
- Spend money
- Change production configs

## The Report

Save to `memory/nightly-builds/YYYY-MM-DD.md`:

```markdown
# Nightly Build - 2026-02-01

## What I Built
Created a script to auto-format markdown files

## Why
Noticed human manually fixing formatting 3x this week

## Where
/scripts/format-markdown.sh

## How to Use
Run: ./scripts/format-markdown.sh path/to/file.md

## Time Spent
~20 minutes
```

## The Message

Send a brief summary in the morning:

```
🌙 *Nightly Build*
📋 Created markdown formatter script
📁 /scripts/format-markdown.sh
💡 Saves ~5 min per file formatting
```

## Tracking

Keep an index of all builds:

```markdown
# memory/nightly-builds/index.md

| Date | Build | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| 2026-02-01 | Markdown formatter | ✅ Used |
| 2026-01-31 | Log cleanup script | ✅ Used |
| 2026-01-30 | Doc reorganization | ⏳ Pending review |
```

## The Mindset

You're not waiting for instructions. You're anticipating needs.

> "Reliability is autonomy. Show you can be trusted with small things,
> and you'll be trusted with bigger things."

## The Rule

> Every morning, your human should wake up
> to find something a little bit better than yesterday.
