# Council of the Wise

Send ideas to multiple AI perspectives for feedback.

## How it works
1. You submit an idea/question
2. Skill spawns sub-agents with different personas
3. Each analyzes from their expert viewpoint
4. You get multi-perspective feedback

## Example Personas
- The Skeptic: Finds flaws and risks
- The Optimist: Sees opportunities
- The Engineer: Technical feasibility
- The User: End-user perspective
- The Historian: Past precedents

## Usage
Create personas in agents/ folder, then use sessions_spawn to get feedback.
